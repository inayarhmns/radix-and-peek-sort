# radix-and-peek-sort
Radix sort algorithm is in `radixsort.py`.
Peek sort algorithm is in `peeksort.py`.
`algorithm_texting.py` is used to test algorithms and it outputs to `memory.txt` and `time.txt`.
All txt files are datasets generated by `input_generator.py` except for `memory.txt` and `time.txt` which are results of the conducted experiments on `algorithm_texting.py`.
